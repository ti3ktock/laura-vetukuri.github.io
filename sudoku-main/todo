Transferred notes from paper and evolved todo list:
Todo:
27. felhantering for typo or other input than the needed one.
30. I could actually combine the exit the game and show sudoku in one command

Would be good to have
    26. make a generated sudoku
    18. make a score board
    19. store game "points/wins"


Done:
1. install numpy
2. import numpy as np
3. create an empty board 9x9
4. create board layout
5. write sudoku rules(valid moves)
6. print board with reference letters and numbers
# Have to decide between a generated sudoku or a sample sudoku.
7. decided to make a sample sudoku
8. make the sudoku solve itself
9. remove the solve code, so that i can add user input
10. add user input
11. add user input number into board
12. print the updated board after every input
20. jupiter  notebook is not the most user friendly for playing this game. Can't see the moves after every input
21. switch back to py file
13. make sure that the number is valid
#Repeat text of the above# -->22. ! just saw that it adds the number but it wont check if the number is a valid number for that cell. Fix that
25. there are too many solutions for the sudoku, make a solved sudoku list and use that as a template if it is a valid number or not
16. is board complete?
14. write  message for wrong input or other errors
28. I noticed that when i start the game it prints the board 2 times. I forgot to remove the printed board from before the while loop takes place.  Done
29. activate the solve sudoku code and write a code for the user to choose if they want to have the game solved
17. add more sample sudokus (or nr 26)
15. quit game option before the sudoku is solved(not difficult, but not a priority)
23. comment the code
24. write a detailed description of the application
