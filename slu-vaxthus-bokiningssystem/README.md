# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Step 1 create file
step 2 (if no node.js install, if no vite, install) set up a vite  react project: "npm init vite@latest ." in javascript
step 3 for later stage to use routing: "npm install react-router-dom@latest"

step 4 react is started with "npm run dev"
